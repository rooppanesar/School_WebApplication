					<h3> <strong> 1-Why Kindergarten?</strong></h3>
					<div class="b2"></div>
					<p>
						Most children begin kindergarten at the age of five. However, many parents are starting to question 
						the importance of kindergarten and whether their children even need to go. It is a fact that in most 
						places kindergarten is not required although the education acquired in kindergarten is required for 
						the student who wants to go straight to first grade. The answer to the question is that kindergarten 
						is really important and has many advantages.
					</p>
					<h4><strong>Learn the Basics</strong></h4>
					<p>
						When your child attends kindergarten he will learn the basics. This means the basics in math, science, 
						reading, writing, social skills and more. You want your child to be prepared for the first grade and 
						beyond and in almost all cases kindergarten accomplishes that. If your child skips kindergarten then 
						he may be prepared for first grade anyway, but he may still be behind. Kindergarten will expose your 
						child to all the things he should know so that by the time he does reach first grade he will be prepared.
					</p>
					<h4><strong>Socialization</strong></h4>
					<p>
						Kindergarten prepares children for the following school years because they meet new friends and learn 
						how to communicate. Developing these communication skills early on is important because the sooner 
						children learn how to communicate well the sooner they can do so. When kids are required to share and 
						play  with one another they will store that information and it will shape how they treat others for the 
						rest of their lives.
					</p>
					<h4><strong>Accustomed to School</strong></h4>
					<p>
						Another reason why kindergarten is important is because it allows the child to become accustomed to school. 
						Kids will have to start attending school on a daily basis until they turn at least 18 years old so it is 
						important to go ahead and let them become accustomed to attending school while they are young. Then a full 
						day of school in first grade and beyond wont be such a shock.
